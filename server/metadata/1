{"name": "Lagrange [1]", "image": "ipfs://QmcZWEef3McnTVDBsMP6PY9WAeY7Xa9UKvFADPUeezVcK4", "description": "These symmetrical objects live in hyperspace, beyond the 3-dimensional world that we inhabit. So it is impossible to draw pictures or make models of them. Instead, we use the powerful language of mathematics and in particular group theory to explore their properties. Each symmetrical object constructed is unique because the symmetries interact with each other in their own special way. They are special because the structures of these objects are connected to the arithmetic of elliptic curves. If you would like to explore a little bit more of the mathematical significance of these groups then these two papers are where the first groups I constructed are explained. But, be warned, you'll probably need a maths degree to understand the intricacies of these papers.
