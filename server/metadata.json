So it is impossible to draw pictures or make models of them. Instead, we use the powerful language of mathematics and in particular group theory to explore their properties. Each symmetrical object constructed is unique because the symmetries interact with each other in their own special way. They are special because the structures of these objects are connected to the arithmetic of elliptic curves.
